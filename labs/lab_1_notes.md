Lab 1 notes

- can work in vs code, but if it takes a long time to work, upload to Google Colab (with my T4 GPU) - it will load much faster when we are training transformers 

# Magic commands
- special commands in IPython or Jupyter Notebooks.
- an extra feature that helps with interactive work, debugging, timing, and system tasks
## Magic used in this course : 

### automatically re-load imported modules every time before executing the Python code typed
### if you use Colab, just comment out the following two lines
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

### automatically include matplotlib plots in the frontend of the notebook and save them with the notebook
%matplotlib inline
