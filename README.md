# nlp
ku course, semester 3

## workflow
**editing jupyter notebooks in vs code & keeping github up to date**

1. **open** nlp folder in vs code ~nlp/nlp
   1. this is a repository that i cloned from github online, so that i have a local version i can work on

2. **pull** latest changes from online repo
   1. *methods*
      1. click the arrows in the status bar (bottom left of vs code)
      2. CMD SHIFT P -> Git: Pull
   2. *why*
      1. this updates my local repository - so if i uploaded documents to the github online version, then these documents will appear in my local repository, allowing me to update them 

3. **edit** document
   1. open the `.ipynb` document in vs code & edit
   2. save with CMD S
      1. this saves changes to the file on my computer disk

4. **commit & push** changes
   1. *method*
      1. source control view (left hand size) -> write a message explaining the change -> Commit -> Push
         1. or can click the arrow next to Commit, and click Commit & Push
   2. *commit - what*
      1. takes the current version of my saved file & stores in my local Git repo
      2. allows me to track changes 
   3. *push - what*
      1. sends the local commits from my local git repo -> to my online (remote) Github repo
      2. so i can see changes in online github 
      3. and others can see it (if the repo is shared with them )
