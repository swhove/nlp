# nlp
ku course, semester 3

## workflow
editing jupyter notebooks in vs code & keeping github up to date

1. open nlp folder in vs code ~nlp/nlp
   1. this is a repository that i cloned from github online, so that i have a local version i can work on

2. pull latest changes
   1. methods
      1. click the arrows in the status bar (bottom left of vs code)
      2. CMD SHIFT P -> Git: Pull
   2. why
      1. this updates my local repository - so if i uploaded documents to the github online version, then these documents will appear in my local repository, allowing me to update them 

3. edit document
   1. open the `.ipynb` document in vs code, save with CMD S

4. commit changes
   1. method
      1. source control view (left hand size) -> write a message explaining the change -> Commit
   2. why 
      1. to synchronize changes here with online github
      2. so i can see the changes in online github
